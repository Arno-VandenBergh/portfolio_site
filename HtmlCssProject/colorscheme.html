            <section><h2 id="dessert">Dessert</h2>
                <p>Pumpkin pie is a dessert pie with a spiced, pumpkin-based custard filling. The pumpkin is a symbol of
                    harvest
                    time, and pumpkin pie is generally eaten during the fall and early winter. In the United States and
                    Canada,
                    it is usually prepared for Thanksgiving, and other occasions when pumpkin is in season.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>The pie filling ranges in color from orange to brown and is baked in a single pie shell, rarely with
                    a
                    top
                    crust. The pie is generally flavored with cinnamon, powdered ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. Allspice is
                    also
                    commonly used and can replace the clove and nutmeg, as its flavor is similar to both combined.
                    Cardamom
                    and
                    vanilla are also sometimes used as batter spices. The spice mixture is called pumpkin pie spice.</p>


                <p>The pie is often made from canned pumpkin or packaged pumpkin pie filling (spices included), mainly
                    from
                    varieties of Cucurbita moschata.</p></section>

                <p>Pies made from pumpkins use pie pumpkins which measure about 15 to 20 centimetres (6 to 8 inches) in
                    diameter.
                    They are considerably smaller than jack o'lanterns. The first step for getting the edible part out
                    of
                    the
                    pumpkin is to slice it in half and remove the seeds. The two halves are heated until soft, in an
                    oven,
                    over
                    an
                    open fire, on a stove top, or in a microwave oven. Sometimes the pumpkin halves are brined to soften
                    the
                    pulp
                    instead of being cooked. At this point, the pulp is scooped out and puréed.[citation needed]</p>


                <p>The pulp is mixed with eggs, evaporated and/or sweetened condensed milk, sugar, and a spice mixture
                    called
                    pumpkin pie spice, which includes nutmeg and other spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice,
                    mace),
                    then
                    baked in a pie shell. Similar pies are made with butternut squash or sweet potato fillings. Pumpkin

                    is
                    often served at Thanksgiving dinner.</p></section>
            <section class="hide2"><h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p>The pumpkin is native to the continent of North America. The pumpkin was an early export to France;
                    from
                    there it
                    was introduced to Tudor England, and the flesh of the "pompion" was quickly accepted as pie filler.
                    During
                    the
                    seventeenth century, pumpkin pie recipes could be found in English cookbooks, such as Hannah
                    Woolley's
                    The
                    Gentlewoman's Companion (1675). Pumpkin "pies" made by early American colonists were more likely to
                    be a
                    savory soup made and served in a pumpkin than a sweet custard in a crust.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>It was not until the early nineteenth century that the recipes appeared in Canadian and American
                    cookbooks
                    or pumpkin pie became a common addition to the Thanksgiving dinner. The Pilgrims brought the pumpkin
                    pie
                    back
                    to New England, while the English method of cooking the pumpkin took a different course. In the 19th
                    century,
                    the English pumpkin pie was prepared by stuffing the pumpkin with apples, spices, and sugar and then
                    baking
                    it
                    whole. In the United States after the Civil War, the pumpkin pie was resisted in southern states as
                    a
                    symbol of Yankee culture imposed on the south, where there was no tradition of eating pumpkin pie.
                    Many
                    southern cooks instead made sweet potato pie, or added bourbon and pecans to give a southern
                    touch.</p>

                <p>Today, throughout much of Canada and the United States, it is traditional to serve pumpkin pie after
                    Thanksgiving dinner. Additionally, many modern companies produce seasonal pumpkin pie-flavored
                    products
                    such
                    as
                    candy, cheesecake, coffee, ice cream, french toast, waffles and pancakes, and many breweries produce
                    a
                    seasonal
                    pumpkin ale or beer; these are generally not flavored with pumpkins, but rather pumpkin pie spices.
                    Commercially
                    made pumpkin pie mix is made from Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata. (Libby
                    Select
                    uses
                    the
                    Select Dickinson Pumpkin variety of C. moschata for its canned pumpkins.)</p>

                <p>Pumpkin pies were briefly discouraged from Thanksgiving dinners in 1947 as part of a rationing
                    campaign,
                    mainly
                    because of the eggs in the recipe.</p></section>

                <h3>Poetry</h3>
                <p>Lydia Maria Child's Thanksgiving poem "Over the River and Through the Wood" (1844) references pumpkin
                    pie
                    in
                    one
                    of
